## Tagline

The tagline has been shortened to:

`Holochain is a framework for buliding & running secure, fully peer-to-peer distributed apps.`

The current tagline on https://developer.holochain.org is:

```
Holochain is a framework for building and running secure, fully peer-to-peer distributed apps.

It has never been easier to build the distributed app you've been thinking about.
```

### platform vs framework

Platform better describes what Holochain is, opposed to Framework.
Holochain is a platform that has many frameworks associated with it.

Platform https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing_platform

A computing platform or digital platform is the environment
	in which a piece of software is executed.
It may be the hardware or the operating system (OS),
	even a web browser and associated application programming interfaces,
	or other underlying software, as long as the program code is executed with it.
Computing platforms have different abstraction levels,
	including a computer architecture, an OS, or runtime libraries.
A computing platform is the stage on which computer programs can run. 

Framework https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_framework 

In computer programming, a software framework is an abstraction
	in which software providing generic functionality can be
	selectively changed by additional user-written code,
	thus providing application-specific software.
A software framework provides a standard way to build and deploy applications.
A software framework is a universal, reusable software environment
	that provides particular functionality as part of a
	larger software platform to facilitate development of
	software applications, products and solutions.
Software frameworks may include support programs, compilers, code libraries,
	tool sets, and application programming interfaces (APIs)
	that bring together all the different components
	to enable development of a project or system.
