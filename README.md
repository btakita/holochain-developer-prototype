## Philosophy

### Order & Chaos

Creative collaborative endeavors have elements of Order & Chaos.

Order brings structure, cohesion, & a static way.
	Chaos brings dissolution, diffusion, & dynamism

With dissolution of current order, new order can be created.

Chaos brings a state of unease, inspiring beings in nature to create order
	to work with the chaos.

### Assumptions & Focus

It's common for domain experts to focus on Advanced Knowledge built upon a layer of assumptions.
Our fetish for the expert beguiles the audience & the expert alike,
	playing their roles in the theater of sophistry.

It is important regularly examine all assumptions in design to remain in touch
	with the audience & with the fundamental objectives.
This includes understanding the nature & effect:

* first of text, primitive elements, layout
* then polish
* then further iteration

Initial application of polish, while appealing, hide information architecture issues
	and make early design conversations co-mingled with separate concerns.

## Inspiration & Analogous Analysis

It's important to use the correct analogies.
The wrong analogy leads to a false order,
	ultimately being destroyed by it's own contradictions.

### [ethereum.org](https://ethereum.org )

Ethereum simplified their Information Architecture according to principles in
	https://github.com/ethereum/ethereum-org-website/.
It would be of great value to articulate principles specific to Holochain.

The navigation is split into 4 sections:

* Beginners
* Use - Using apps & currency in the Holochain Ecosystem
* Learn - Links & Resources to learn more about Holochain
* Build - Building hApps & build core code

It's mainly written in markdown using [vuepress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/).

### [developers.eos.io/](https://developers.eos.io/)

Provides a more structured experience than ethereum.org.

Navigation links are jargon & not goal-oriented.

API docs are not unified with the site experience.

### [svelte.dev](https://svelte.dev)

Home page highlights 3 arguments to use svelte with blog post:

* Write Less Code
* No Virtual DOM
* Truly Reactive

Provides interactive examples of creating components in the tutorial.

Uses starter repos to jumpstart development.

### [Gatsbyjs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/)

Beautiful icons.

Good visualization of process flow.
This is important to describe one of the many processes that
	Holochain developers would interact with.
